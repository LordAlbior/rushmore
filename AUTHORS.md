# Hall of Honor

The Rushmore Engine is the brainchild of the Software Engineer *Albert
Tavares de Almeida* born when he asked himself "What if?" when
ruminating about the possibility for the future of Game Engines.

This is the quasi-mythical digital text hall, the Valhalla to honor all
the brave souls devoted to this foolish dream. If you ever do contribute
to this lovely piece of software, join the names written in this
documents as you have earned your right to do so.

*WE HONOR THESE BRAVE TECH WARRIORS WHOM WEAPON IS THE MIGHTY CODE*
