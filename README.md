# Rushmore
> Love. Game Engine. Revolution.

## Motivations

### A polite introduction
> “I miss Rushmore. I miss… the seasons.”

No. I’m not entirely unsatisfied with the state of the Game Engines in the current day and age. I’m also find some of the solutions gave to us cleaver and nice. The reason I began to think about stating this project was curiosity about how far I can push the technology and usability of game engines forward. I have been exposed to a variety of game engines in several languages, made with a myriad of architectural paradigms and for all types of public. 

Every time I found them lacking in some aspect. Some of the more technically powerful game engines are so technical they forget they should be used to make games. Others push the “ease of use” such extent its almost impossible to touch anything underneath even if your life depend on that. In special, most engines are dreadful dealing with procedural content in a decent manner. In special, high scale procedural often need so much work it is better to write a game engine from scratch :wink:.

The main aim of this engine is provide high performance without sacrifice what is important for a game engine: *be able to easily express your intentions*.



### ...and a f*cking rant

>  "Yeah; I was in the shit."



*If you want to jump this part, I’ll not blame you. Rants are so overused I cannot blame you.* 

*Are you with me? OK. Let’s start.*



I know the needs of the industry are a high throughput of games and the standards are very polarized towards simplistic mobile or web games or big AAA Behemoths, but with the growth of high profile Indie games, where are the expressive engines? Where is the engines between the corporate backed giants and the easy entry level ones? I found none that have that satisfactory feel of letting you accomplish things on your on pace without holding you back.

I don’t want to be pressed to choose between having the performance I need and the high level tools for game making I need. I want to be able to stay on my blissful paradise until I decide I want more from the engine. I want to be free from macro hell and other very irritating “necessities” of some other game engines. They do a good work, but I want a great experience.



### Ours

>  "She’s my Rushmore, Max!" "…Yeah; I know. She was mine too."

This is my Engine. But I want it to be yours and everyone else Engine too. To do that I need to define very well what is a Game Engine. Every Game Project has its own needs and every person has its own way to work. There is no wrongs or rights here. Just the raw experience of doing a game.

Don’t be deceived by the thought this is an *“Unopinionated”* experience. There are certain aspects of game development that are well ironed through the years and these will be implemented to endure and perform as best as possible. But there are game related decisions and low-level shenanigan that will be engineered to be configured, substituted, expanded, implemented and tossed away as much as possible. 

If you don’t like one of the decisions we made, just make yourself comfortable as we build this thing to be yours.



## Features

The Rushmore Engine has a small number of core [features](docs/FEATURES.md) planned and several others waiting for [consideration](docs/POSSIBLE.md).

We think these more abstract qualities features too:

### Technical = *Nuts and Bolts*

>  "Nihilo sanctum estne? …Is nothing sacred?"

Nothing is sacred in this forsaken land. Technical knowledge holds no alliances in its core. All options for achieving the best result are possible of analysis or implementations. 

Most technical decisions and architectural analysis will be made clear in the [TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md) document.



### Usability = *Developers are human too*

>  "I can write a hit play. Why can't I have a little drink to unwind
>  myself?"

To make something easy to use is different from dumb down things. Our time, energy and attention span are limited and it is important to look seriously at this issue. The answers to this problem can be summarized be the following qualities to be observed:

- Progressive: Segregate the complexity levels in different and coherent packages.
- Right Abstractions: Use the right abstractions for the work. We are interested in express ideas as best as possible.
- Discoverable: Make important things more easy to spot than the supplementary ones. 
- Orthogonal Interfaces: If there are two ways to do something, it should be one.
- Documentation: Every part of a public interface must be documented in clear language.



### Performance = *Runtime, Compile-time, Dev-time, Your time*

> "So what do you think of Max’s latest opus?"

To be useful, high performance must not trample other needs of the engine. The compile-time must be kept sane and the runtime should not be wasteful. In special, the engine should work to make you do the most of your time. 



### Expandability = *To do big, we need to be small*
> "I understand that you’re a neurosurgeon." "…No; I’m a barber. But a
> lot of people make that mistake."

It is a no brainer any game with some complexity will fall into the situation of need to expand the engine for more than what it was designed to. Dynamic and Static plug-in solutions are being conceived as well as direct engine code expansion and modules.

No man is an Island. Everyone cross paths with a plethora of people in
the course of a lifetime. This place is reserved to the people that
direct or indirectly helped the project (and its author) to flourish.

These are some of these wonderful people (or projects):

* I'm grateful to my mother and sister for understanding the hurdles of
  being a developer.
* My friends for the support when things are not going well. In special,
  I would like to thank [@VileLasagna](https://github.com/VileLasagna)
  and [@mobius3](https://github.com/mobius3) for the critiques and
  ideas.
* All people whose code I used as dependency or incorporated to my code.
  To these people, I separated a special spot on the [Hall of Gratitude]() .
* To Wes Anderson and his inspiring way of doing things.
